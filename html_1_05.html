      <h1>spiderman review</h1>
      <p>Bitten by a radioactive spider in the subway, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales suddenly develops mysterious powers that transform him into the one and only Spider-Man. Spiderman into spider verse was a great movie it was full of surprises and was well plotted. when you watch the movie its really enjoyable because its as if you were reading a comic i really enjoyed watching because it was full of humor and had really good action scenes. </p>
